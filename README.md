## Installation

### General information

I assume that you're not familiar with PHP applications and how to install them. Let's split the whole install process into significant parts:
1. Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
2. ...

Note that this is the easiest way to install the application because the program is designed to work locally. For example astro-quiz doesn't use any database but stores all information in text files and uses a session mechanism.
